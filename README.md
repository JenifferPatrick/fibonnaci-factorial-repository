Code Explanation
Fibonacci Series
The Fibonacci sequence is generated using iteration. Given n terms, it prints the series using two variables that store previous values.

âœ… What is the Fibonacci Series?
The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first two terms are always 0 and 1.

Mathematically:

F(n) = F(nâˆ’1) + F(nâˆ’2)
Where:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 0 + 1 = 1
F(3) = 1 + 1 = 2
F(4) = 1 + 2 = 3, and so on.
âœ… Code Breakdown
Input Handling: The user enters how many terms they want.
Loop Execution: A for loop runs n times, printing each Fibonacci number.
Efficient Calculation: Each Fibonacci number is calculated without recursion, making it efficient.
Runtime Measurement: The execution time of the Fibonacci function is measured in microseconds.

Factorial Calculation
The factorial of a number n is computed iteratively. The factorial of n is given by:
n! = n Ã— (n-1) Ã— (n-2) Ã— ... Ã— 1

âœ… Code Breakdown
Input Handling: The user is prompted to enter a number.
Factorial Calculation:
If the number is 0 or 1, the function immediately returns 1.
Otherwise, a for loop runs from 2 to n, multiplying all numbers.
Efficiency Considerations:
Uses an iterative approach (instead of recursion) to avoid stack overflow for large numbers.
Uses a long long variable to handle large factorial values.
Runtime Measurement: The execution time of the factorial function is measured in microseconds.

Design of Algorithms
Fibonacci Series:
Time Complexity: O(n) â€” We calculate each Fibonacci number once.
Space Complexity: O(1) â€” The space usage is constant because we only use a fixed number of variables for storing the previous two terms.
Factorial Calculation:
Time Complexity: O(n) â€” The loop iterates n times to compute the factorial.
Space Complexity: O(1) â€” Since we use a single variable for the result, the space complexity remains constant.
