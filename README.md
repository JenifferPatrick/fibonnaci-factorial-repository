## Code Explanation
### Fibonacci Series
The Fibonacci sequence is generated using iteration. Given `n` terms, it prints the series using two variables that store previous values.

- **How to Compile & Run:**
``sh
g++ fibonacci.cpp -o fibonacci
./fibonacci

### Factorial Calculation
The factorial of a number `n` is computed iteratively. The factorial of `n` is given by: n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1


- **How to Compile & Run:**
``sh 
g++ factorial.cpp -o factorial
./factorial
